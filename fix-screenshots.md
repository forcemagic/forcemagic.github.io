# Fix Screenshots in the Ghost app :D

> Note: This only works on Windows. If you're running something else, you should figure the steps out yourself :P

## You will need:
- An Android phone (yes, it only works on those)
- A USB cable
- A laptop/PC

## Steps:

1. Enable *USB Debugging* on your device. [This](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable) site can show you how (official).  
   Also, maybe [this video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucs34BkfPB0) could help.

1. Download [this](./FixScreenshots.zip) file.

2. Right click > Extract all  
  From a browser, click on *Open containing folder*, then do the above.

3. Open the folder and double-click the **Fix Screenshots** file

4. Connect your phone, tap *Allow* on it, and wait for the magic to happen!! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
